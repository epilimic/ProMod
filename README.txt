Pro Mod - L4D2 Competitive Config - Version 4.0
Website: http://l4dpromod.com

Pro Mod is a configuration for Left 4 Dead 2 built for LGOFNOC [pre 4.0: Confogl] with the purpose of
making competitive play more balanced and interesting. It's the most recent set of
changes from an evolving set of ideas put forth from other configs such as Fresh
and Metafogl, as well as the community.

Installation Instructions (Must be done in ORDER)
================================================================================
Pre-install note: This guide and linked packages are for LINUX servers only. This guide also assumes you have a clean vanilla server to start with.
At this time windows is not fully supported. For more information on setting up a windows server please visit: http://www.l4dnation.com/confogl-and-other-configs/does-promod-work-on-windows-server/ and also note that you will still need LGOFNOC and the updated Match Vote to play Pro Mod 4.0

Step 1 - Stop Server
Step 2 - Install MM+SM+Updated Files combo, or skip to Step 3
Step 3 - Install Metamod: Source
Step 4 - Install Sourcemod
Step 5 - Install Required files
Step 6 - Install Pro Mod
Step 7 - Start Server
====================================================================================


-----------------[Step 1 - Stop Server]-----------------------------------------
Stop your server in the control panel of your GSP. Not doing this step sometimes causes issues when installing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------[Step 2 - Install MM+SM+Required Files combo]------------------
Combo Pack: MetaMod + SourceMod + All Required Files (except Pro Mod)
Download: http://l4dpromod.com/files/required/lgofnoc_fullpackage_1.0.zip
Install: Extract and upload to your server's /left4dead2/ folder.

This is a fully working server package with all prerequisite files included and covers steps 3-6. If you do not wish to install this package and prefer to install everything separate, skip to Step 3 - Install Metamod: Source.

Also keep in mind that this is a full install, if you have configs edited (admin_simple.ini), this will overwrite it.

This package contains:
Metamod
Sourcemod
Left4Downtown
L4DToolz
Stripper:Source
DHooks
Builtin Votes
L4D2 Direct
LGOFNOC
Match Vote

We have removed a few files that aren't needed for the sake of keeping the package a bit smaller. Things removed include binaries/gamedata for games other than l4d2, and the entire scripting folder of sourcemod.

Once installed, skip to Step 6 - Install Pro Mod.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------[Step 3 - Install Metamod: Source]-----------------------------
If you already have Metamod: Source installed, check your version. If you are using at least 1.10.1, skip this step.

Download: http://l4dpromod.com/files/required/metamod_1.10.1-hg870.zip
Source: http://sourcemm.net/snapshots
Install: Extract and upload to your server's /left4dead2/ folder.

After that, go to the metamod site and click Make your VDF and choose Left 4 Dead 2. This is not required if you download MetaMod from our Downloads page.
Download the metamod.vdf put it inside the "../addons/" folder. Also not required if you downloaded from our Downloads page.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Source: http://www.sourcemod.net/snapshots.php
Install: Extract and upload to your server's /left4dead2/ folder.

We Recommend: Version 1.6.0-hg4140+ (below this and the latest SMAC won't fully work)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------[Step 5 - Install Required files]------------------------------

Source: http://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=162164
Install: Extract and upload to your server's /left4dead2/ folder.

L4D2 Direct
Download: L4D2 Direct (latest) http://l4dpromod.com/files/required/l4d2_direct.zip
Source: https://github.com/ConfoglTeam/l4d2_direct/blob/master/gamedata/l4d2_direct.txt
Install: Extract and upload to your server's /left4dead2/ folder.

LGOFNOC
Download: LGOFNOC (1.0) http://l4dpromod.com/files/required/lgofnoc_1.0.zip
Source: https://github.com/ConfoglTeam/LGOFNOC
Install: Extract and upload to your server's /left4dead2/ folder.
Important: LGOFNOC & Pro Mod 4.0+ is not compatible with Confogl. You must remove confoglcompmod.smx from your server's addons/plugins/ folder for Pro Mod 4.0 to work.

Match Vote
Download: Match Vote(1.2) http://l4dpromod.com/files/required/match_vote_1.2.zip
Source: https://github.com/Stabbath/sm_plugins/tree/master/match_vote
Install: Extract and upload to your server's /left4dead2/ folder.
Important: Any prior version of match_vote is not compatible with LGOFNOC. You must replace your existing match_vote.smx from your server's addons/plugins/ folder for LGOFNOC to work.


Lastly, if you already have sdkhooks installed, you'll need to make sure these files aren't in your sourcemod folder:

    gamedata/sdkhooks.games.txt
    extensions/sdkhooks.ext.dll
    extensions/sdkhooks.ext.so

If they are, DELETE them. They are left overs of an outdated version of SDK Hooks and will cause conflicts on your server. SDKHooks is now built into the recommended version of Sourcemod.
All prerequired files for Pro Mod are now installed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------[Step 6 - Install Promod]-------------------------------------
Download Pro Mod 4.0. http://l4dpromod.com/files/ver/ProMod4.0.zip
Extract and upload to your server's /left4dead2/ folder and overwrite anything that it asks to.
Promod is now installed. If you're installing other configs, make sure Pro Mod's plugins aren't overwritten by them as they may not work as intended.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------[Step 7 - Start Server]---------------------------------------
Restart your server and connect to it.
Once in game type in console "sm version" and "meta version" to check if both are installed.
Try to start a config with !forcematch promod.
To check plugins are loaded type "sm plugins" in console, then say !resetmatch in chat to see if it correctly unloads then try another config.
Your server is now installed, gg.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


===============================================================================
Additional Q/A
===============================================================================

  ["Commands like !forcestart and !forcematch aren't working."]

  If everything else works, you probably need to set admins in sourcemod.
  See here: http://wiki.alliedmods.net/Adding_Admins_%28SourceMod%29

  ["How do I get other configs like EQ into the match vote menu?"]

  You must add them in (addons/sourcemod/configs/matchmodes.txt) and then add this
  line into the confogl_plugins.cfg file of the config you wish to add:

        sm plugins load match_vote.smx

  Additionally you may add the above line to your confogl_personalize.cfg so that it is
  universally loaded for all configs, but you must still edit matchmodes.txt.

  ["SI sounds are off, I can hear SI spawns on survivor, or my teammates are invisible."]

  SMAC's wallhack plugin causes these issues as well as causes hit registration issues.
  We really don't recommend using it with Left 4 Dead 2. Other SMAC plugins however are
  very much recommended to prevent cheating.


  ["How do I fix (issue) with Fresh/Metafogl/Etc with Pro Mod installed?"]

  Older configs aren't supported because of plugin updates that change cvars or break
  old functionality. If you want to fix them to work with Pro Mod installed feel free
  but they aren't supported. Good luck to you.


  ["Where is zombie bat?"]

  Zombie bat lives in all of us.

Changelog
===============================================================================

4.0
Main Changes:
- ProMod now uses damage bonus. Parity will now be the exact health bonus equivalent of ProMod.
- Removed l4d_hots and l4d2_nobhaps from every config, enabling instant pill health and tank bhops.
- Tweaked l4d2_startercommon: it now lowers the common limit on round start and instantly resets it upon leaving saferoom.
- Added caster_assister to help spectators, especially streamers/casters, move around more naturally.
- Added tank rock selector plugin, CanadaRox's version: just pressing Use or Reload alone will start the rock throw.
- Added l4d2_spitter_manager to allow people to opt for a new SI if they have a spitter when tank spawns. Press R.
- Added staggersolver to block button presses during stumbles.
- Removed No Mercy 5 and Dead Center 4 wipefest flow tanks.
- The 2nd finale tank (not counting possible flow tanks) is now blocked, to makes finales shorter and more survivable.
- Hard Rain 2 has multiple witches again, but with reduced health (only 500).
- Hard Rain 1 only has 1 SMG and 1 pump shotgun in saferoom: to get more primary weapons players must go into the diner.
- 4v4 configs now have 1 extra pill.
- Added zombie bat.
- Insta pounce is fixed (Hunters & Jockeys)
- Ladderblocking is fixed, the blocker will simply be pushed away.
- When a survivor dies, he/she will always drop his secondary weapon (Pistol, Melee)
- Engine Fixes are applied (Picking up players won't prevent fall damage)
- Blocked texture manager mathack.
- Heavily reworked map distances. They were initially based on a mix of the typical distance and health scores as logged by the l4d2-logger, on a scale of 300 to 1000 (300 for parish 1, which was used as the base), with small human adjustments and about ~150-200 points being removed for each tank that will be blocked in 4.0. With the shift to DB, the goal will be to base the maximum distance scores strictly on the average damage bonus people have at the end of the map (another benefit of DB is that we can do that and end up with perfect scoring balance).
- Changed charger scratch damage to 8 per hit.
- Replaced tank control plugin with Arti's new one. Now works with Custom Map Transitions and has new functionality like !givetank for admins.
- Added tank pain fade, screen flashes red when being meleed from behind.
- Reintroduced legacy "!match configname" feature. Note: Must type name correct. If you aren't 100% sure, just use the normal !match menu.
- Added glowism plugin. Call the vote in game with !realism to enable realism cvars. Saying !noglows will call a vote to only disable glows. (!glows and !unrealism will disable; admins can force either one)
- Tank grace period reduced from 25 to 20. LOS delay reduced from 2 seconds to 1. Rage meter reduced from 20 seconds to 18.
- Modified or removed most or all of Promod 3.3.3's props. Props that hurt SI more than helped were tweaked or changed based on competitive feedback. Unnecessary/excessive props were removed.
- Fixed or blocked several exploits, glitch spots, punch spots, and stuck spots
- You no longer have to prespawn to get inside of the breakable walls near the Dark Carnival 2 event
- Nerfed the No Mercy 5 and Cold Stream 3 first ladder deathcharges
- Removed Promod 3.3.3 Hard Rain 4 alarm car event near end saferoom (path still exists, however)
- Re-allowed Survivors to jump from the blue truck to the fences to the rooftop in Hard Rain 4
- Significantly reduced hittables on Passing 1 due to balance issues. Reduced hittables slightly on Death Toll 1 opening area to allow early Tanks once again. 
- Added back shopping carts on dead center 2 in the event area.
- Added Connect Announce (You can customize it by editing addons/sourcemod/data/cannounce_settings.txt)
- Fixed Death Toll finale. Chrome / Silenced SMG always on the dock and 4 pills always on the fireplace in the picnic pavilion.
- Fixed water slowdown not being applied in some cases. Tweaked value from 32.72% to 28%. 


Other Changes:
- Added witch_announce and other small plugins that were needed or popularly requested, like the ones listed at the end of the Main Changes (thanks to Jahze, Sir and Visor).
- Removed l4d_tank_rush from whichever configs had it.
- Converted from confogl+l4d2lib to lgofnoc.
- Added CCT's spit damage blockers to the regular plugin.
- Separated custom map distances into a separate plugin from scoremod.

    - There is a limit of 2 equipped melee weapons in every config (will probably be tweaked).
    - Respawn intervals for all 1v1/2v2/3v3/4v4 configs are set to 8/11/13/17.

    - Normal mob sizes are set to 0.83 times common limit.
    - Starting common limit is set to 0.33 times common limit (from l4d2_startercommon).
    - Tank healths are 1000/2000/3000/4000 (multiply by 1.5 for the real versus value).
- All item spawns are now handled by universal-item-manager.
- Removed l4d_nocans, all canister, can and firework removal is now done by universal-item-manager.
- Changed the way plugins are loaded to be more developer-friendly. Plugin loads and cvar settings are divided into .cfg modules, selectively executed by each config that wants that module's features:
    - There's a .cfg for the standard promod settings.
    - There's a .cfg for each possible player number (1v1/2v2/3v3/4v4).
    - There's a .cfg for adding a nerfed hr.
    - There's a .cfg to have hunters only.
    - ... for db.
    - ... for hb.
	- etc...
- Likely other smaller changes that were forgotten.

- Changed all map distances to 200.

3.2
- Added plugin to track statistics for further balance changes (no private information is taken)
- Added plugin to allow SI to warp to survivors as ghosts based on survivor position in map:
    Use: sm_warpto <1-4> (ex 1=Front 4=Back) or <name> (such as Ellis or Louis)
- Added plugin to keep being-shot hunters from losing pouncability against other objects
- Added plugin for players to set scores directly in the event of a server crash
